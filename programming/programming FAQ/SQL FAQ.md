## **General Questions**

### **1. What is SQL?**
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQL allows users to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and creating or modifying database structures.

### **2. What are the main features of SQL?**
- **Data Querying**: Retrieve data from databases.
- **Data Manipulation**: Insert, update, and delete data.
- **Database Definition**: Define and modify database schemas.
- **Data Control**: Manage access permissions and control user interactions.

### **3. What are the common SQL databases?**
Popular SQL databases include:
- **MySQL**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **SQLite**
- **Oracle Database**

## **SQL Basics**

### **1. What is a SQL query?**
A SQL query is a request for data or information from a database. Queries are written in SQL and can perform a variety of operations, including retrieving, updating, or deleting data.

- **Basic Query Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees;
  ```

### **2. How do I create a database in SQL?**

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;
  ```

### **3. How do I use SQL to create a table?**

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50),
      HireDate DATE
  );
  ```

## **Data Types**

### **1. What are the common SQL data types?**

- **INT**: Integer numbers.
- **VARCHAR(n)**: Variable-length character strings.
- **CHAR(n)**: Fixed-length character strings.
- **DATE**: Date values.
- **FLOAT**: Floating-point numbers.
- **BOOLEAN**: True or false values.

### **2. How do I define constraints in SQL?**

Constraints enforce rules on data in tables. Common constraints include:

- **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each record.
- **FOREIGN KEY**: Ensures referential integrity between tables.
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
- **NOT NULL**: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Orders (
      OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      CustomerID INT,
      OrderDate DATE,
      FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
  );
  ```

## **Database Design**

### **1. What is normalization?**

Normalization is the process of organizing database structures to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a database into related tables and defining relationships between them.

### **2. What are the normal forms?**

- **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Eliminate repeating groups and ensure each column contains atomic values.
- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Ensure all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Ensure that all attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key and not on other non-key attributes.

## **CRUD Operations**

### **1. How do I insert data into a table?**

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate)
  VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '2024-01-01');
  ```

### **2. How do I update data in a table?**

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE Employees
  SET LastName = 'Smith'
  WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
  ```

### **3. How do I delete data from a table?**

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Employees
  WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
  ```

### **4. How do I retrieve data from a table?**

- **Basic Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees;
  ```

- **Query with Conditions**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees
  WHERE HireDate > '2024-01-01';
  ```

## **Advanced Queries**

### **1. How do I use SQL functions?**

SQL functions perform operations on data and return results. Common functions include aggregate functions and scalar functions.

- **Aggregate Function Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees FROM Employees;
  ```

- **Scalar Function Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT UPPER(FirstName) AS UppercaseName FROM Employees;
  ```

### **2. How do I use subqueries in SQL?**

A subquery is a query within another query:

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName
  FROM Employees
  WHERE EmployeeID IN (SELECT EmployeeID FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate > '2024-01-01');
  ```

## **Joins and Relationships**

### **1. What are SQL joins?**

Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Common types of joins include:

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**: Returns rows with matches in either table.

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.FirstName, Orders.OrderDate
  FROM Employees
  INNER JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID;
  ```

### **2. How do I define relationships between tables?**

Relationships between tables are defined using foreign keys:

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Orders (
      OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      CustomerID INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
  );
  ```

## **Indexes and Performance**

### **1. What is an index in SQL?**

An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations. Indexes are created on columns that are frequently used in search conditions.

- **Creating an Index**:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees(LastName);
  ```

### **2. How do indexes affect performance?**

- **Benefits**: Faster query performance for SELECT operations.
- **Drawbacks**: Slower performance for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations due to index maintenance.

## **Transactions and Concurrency**

### **1. What is a transaction in SQL?**

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. Transactions ensure data integrity and consistency.

- **Basic Transaction Commands**:
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  -- SQL operations
  COMMIT;  -- or ROLLBACK in case of errors
  ```

### **2. How do I handle concurrency in SQL?**

Concurrency control manages simultaneous operations without conflicting. Techniques include locking and isolation levels:

- **Isolation Levels**: Control the visibility of changes made by transactions.
    - **READ UNCOMMITTED**
    - **READ COMMITTED**
    - **REPEATABLE READ**
    - **SERIALIZABLE**

## **Error Handling**

### **1. How do I handle errors in SQL?**

Error handling in SQL is done using `TRY...CATCH` blocks in some SQL dialects like SQL Server:

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRY
      -- SQL operations
  END TRY
  BEGIN CATCH
      -- Error handling
  END CATCH
  ```

## **Common Issues and Troubleshooting**

### **1. Why is my SQL query returning no results?**

- **Check Conditions**: Ensure that query conditions match the data.
- **Data Presence**: Verify that the table contains the expected data.

### **2. How do I resolve performance issues with SQL queries?**

- **Optimize Queries**: Use indexes, avoid complex joins, and review execution plans.
- **Analyze Execution Plans**: Understand how SQL Server executes queries and identify bottlenecks.
