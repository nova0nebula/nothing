# **Ruby Programming Guide**

## **Introduction**
Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. Designed with a focus on simplicity and elegance, Ruby is often used for web development, scripting, and software engineering. Its object-oriented approach and readable syntax make it a popular choice for developers. This guide provides an in-depth overview of Ruby, covering its syntax, data types, control flow, functions, and more.

## **Getting Started**
### Setting Up Your Environment
To start with Ruby:

1. **Install Ruby**: Download and install Ruby from the [official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). For a managed installation, consider using a version manager like `rbenv` or `RVM`.

2. **Install a Code Editor**: Use any text editor or IDE for Ruby development. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, RubyMine, and Sublime Text.

3. **Write Your First Script**: Create a new file named `hello.rb` with the following content:

   ```ruby
   puts 'Hello, Ruby!'
   ```

   Run the script by typing `ruby hello.rb` in your terminal.

## **Basic Syntax**
### Variables and Data Types
Ruby supports various data types:

- **Numbers**: Integer and Float.
- **Strings**: Textual data.
- **Symbols**: Lightweight, immutable identifiers.
- **Booleans**: `true` and `false`.

Variable assignment:

```ruby
x = 10         # Integer
y = 3.14       # Float
name = "Ruby"  # String
flag = true    # Boolean
symbol = :ruby # Symbol
```

### Operators
Ruby includes arithmetic, relational, and logical operators:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
- **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

Example:

```ruby
a = 5
b = 10
result = a + b       # Addition
is_equal = (a == b)  # Comparison
```

## **Data Types and Structures**
### Arrays
Arrays are ordered collections of elements:

```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.push(6)       # Add element to the end
first_element = arr[0] # Access first element
```

### Hashes
Hashes are key-value pairs:

```ruby
hash = {name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "New York"}
hash[:name]        # Access value associated with key :name
hash[:country] = "USA" # Add new key-value pair
```

### Ranges
Ranges represent a sequence of values:

```ruby
range = (1..5)   # Inclusive range from 1 to 5
range.each do |i|
  puts i
end
```

## **Control Flow**
### Conditional Statements
Use `if`, `elsif`, and `else` for conditional operations:

```ruby
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30
  puts "It's hot outside."
elsif temperature > 20
  puts "The weather is nice."
else
  puts "It's cold outside."
end
```

### Loops
Ruby supports several looping constructs:

- **For Loop**:

```ruby
for i in 1..5
  puts i
end
```

- **While Loop**:

```ruby
i = 1
while i <= 5
  puts i
  i += 1
end
```

- **Each Loop**:

```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.each do |num|
  puts num
end
```

## **Methods and Functions**
### Defining and Calling Methods
Methods are defined using the `def` keyword:

```ruby
def add_numbers(a, b)
  a + b
end

result = add_numbers(3, 4)
puts result
```

### Blocks and Procs
Blocks are chunks of code that can be passed to methods:

```ruby
def greet
  yield
end

greet { puts "Hello from the block!" }
```

Procs are objects that encapsulate blocks of code:

```ruby
my_proc = Proc.new { |x| puts x * 2 }
my_proc.call(5)  # Output: 10
```

### Lambdas
Lambdas are similar to Procs but with different behavior:

```ruby
my_lambda = ->(x) { x * 2 }
puts my_lambda.call(5)  # Output: 10
```

## **File I/O**
### Reading and Writing Files
Ruby provides methods for file operations:

- **Reading a File**:

```ruby
File.open('example.txt', 'r') do |file|
  contents = file.read
  puts contents
end
```

- **Writing to a File**:

```ruby
File.open('example.txt', 'w') do |file|
  file.write("Hello, Ruby!")
end
```

## **Error Handling**
### Exceptions
Use `begin`, `rescue`, and `ensure` for exception handling:

```ruby
begin
  # Code that might raise an exception
  result = 10 / 0
rescue ZeroDivisionError
  puts "You can't divide by zero!"
ensure
  puts "This will always be executed."
end
```

## **Object-Oriented Programming**
### Classes and Objects
Ruby is an object-oriented language. Define classes and create objects:

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hello, my name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end

person = Person.new("Alice", 30)
person.greet
```

### Inheritance
Ruby supports class inheritance:

```ruby
class Animal
  def speak
    puts "Animal speaks"
  end
end

class Dog < Animal
  def speak
    puts "Woof!"
  end
end

dog = Dog.new
dog.speak
```

### Modules
Modules provide namespaces and reusable code:

```ruby
module Greetings
  def self.hello
    puts "Hello from the module!"
  end
end

Greetings.hello
```

## **Libraries and Gems**
### Using Libraries
Ruby libraries are included using `require` or `require_relative`:

```ruby
require 'json'
```

### Installing and Using Gems
Gems are packages that extend Ruby's functionality. Install and use them with Bundler:

1. **Install Bundler**:

   ```sh
   gem install bundler
   ```

2. **Create a `Gemfile`**:

   ```ruby
   source 'https://rubygems.org'
   gem 'rails'
   ```

3. **Install Gems**:

   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

4. **Use a Gem**:

   ```ruby
   require 'rails'
   ```

## **Testing**
### Unit Testing
Ruby supports unit testing with the `minitest` framework:

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'

class TestMath < Minitest::Test
  def test_addition
    assert_equal 4, 2 + 2
  end
end
```

Run tests with `ruby test_file.rb`.

## **Conclusion**
Ruby is a flexible and powerful programming language that excels in simplicity and readability. Its object-oriented nature, combined with a rich set of libraries and frameworks, makes it ideal for a wide range of applications, from web development to scripting. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Ruby, covering its syntax, data types, and advanced features.
