## **General Questions**

### **1. What is Swift?**
Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language developed by Apple Inc. It is designed for building apps for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Swift is known for its safety, performance, and modern syntax.

### **2. What are the main features of Swift?**
- **Safety**: Swift eliminates entire classes of unsafe code, such as null pointer dereferencing.
- **Performance**: Swift is optimized for performance, providing high speed and efficiency.
- **Syntax**: Swift has a clean and expressive syntax that is easy to read and write.
- **Interoperability**: Swift can work with Objective-C code and libraries.

### **3. What platforms can I develop for with Swift?**
Swift is used to develop applications for Apple's platforms, including:
- **iOS**: iPhone and iPad apps
- **macOS**: Desktop applications
- **watchOS**: Apps for Apple Watch
- **tvOS**: Apps for Apple TV

## **Swift Basics**

### **1. How do I declare a variable in Swift?**

Variables in Swift are declared using the `var` keyword. Constants are declared using the `let` keyword.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  var name: String = "John Doe"
  let age: Int = 30
  ```

### **2. What is type inference in Swift?**

Swift can infer the type of a variable or constant from the value it is assigned. You don’t always need to explicitly specify the type.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  var city = "San Francisco"  // Swift infers that city is of type String
  ```

### **3. How do I define a constant in Swift?**

Use the `let` keyword to define a constant whose value cannot be changed once set.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  let pi = 3.14159
  ```

## **Data Types**

### **1. What are the basic data types in Swift?**

- **Int**: Represents integer values.
- **Double**: Represents floating-point numbers with double precision.
- **Float**: Represents floating-point numbers with single precision.
- **Bool**: Represents Boolean values (`true` or `false`).
- **String**: Represents text data.
- **Character**: Represents a single character.

### **2. How do I work with collections in Swift?**

Swift provides several collection types:
- **Array**: An ordered collection of values.
- **Dictionary**: A collection of key-value pairs.
- **Set**: An unordered collection of unique values.

- **Array Example**:
  ```swift
  var numbers: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

- **Dictionary Example**:
  ```swift
  var person: [String: String] = ["firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe"]
  ```

- **Set Example**:
  ```swift
  var uniqueNumbers: Set<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

## **Control Flow**

### **1. How do I use conditional statements in Swift?**

Swift supports conditional statements such as `if`, `else`, and `switch`.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  let number = 10
  if number < 10 {
      print("Number is less than 10")
  } else {
      print("Number is 10 or greater")
  }
  ```

### **2. How do I use loops in Swift?**

Swift provides `for-in`, `while`, and `repeat-while` loops for iteration.

- **For-In Loop Example**:
  ```swift
  for i in 1...5 {
      print(i)
  }
  ```

- **While Loop Example**:
  ```swift
  var counter = 0
  while counter < 5 {
      print(counter)
      counter += 1
  }
  ```

- **Repeat-While Loop Example**:
  ```swift
  var number = 0
  repeat {
      print(number)
      number += 1
  } while number < 5
  ```

## **Functions**

### **1. How do I define a function in Swift?**

Functions are defined using the `func` keyword. They can take parameters and return values.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  func greet(person: String) -> String {
      return "Hello, \(person)!"
  }
  ```

### **2. How do I use closures in Swift?**

Closures are self-contained blocks of code that can be passed around and used in your code. They are similar to functions but can capture and store references to variables and constants from the context in which they were defined.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  let sayHello = { (name: String) -> String in
      return "Hello, \(name)!"
  }
  ```

## **Object-Oriented Programming**

### **1. How do I define a class in Swift?**

Classes in Swift are defined using the `class` keyword. They can have properties and methods.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  class Person {
      var name: String
      var age: Int

      init(name: String, age: Int) {
          self.name = name
          self.age = age
      }

      func introduce() -> String {
          return "Hi, I'm \(name) and I'm \(age) years old."
      }
  }
  ```

### **2. How do I create an instance of a class in Swift?**

Create an instance using the class's initializer.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  let john = Person(name: "John Doe", age: 30)
  print(john.introduce())
  ```

### **3. How do I use inheritance in Swift?**

Classes can inherit from other classes using the `:` syntax.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  class Student: Person {
      var studentID: String

      init(name: String, age: Int, studentID: String) {
          self.studentID = studentID
          super.init(name: name, age: age)
      }

      override func introduce() -> String {
          return "Hi, I'm \(name), a student with ID \(studentID)."
      }
  }
  ```

## **Memory Management**

### **1. What is Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)?**

ARC is Swift’s memory management model that automatically handles the allocation and deallocation of objects to manage memory usage efficiently.

### **2. What are strong, weak, and unowned references?**

- **Strong Reference**: The default reference type, which keeps a strong hold on the object.
- **Weak Reference**: Allows an object to be deallocated even if there are references to it. Used to prevent retain cycles.
- **Unowned Reference**: Similar to weak references but assumes the object will never be nil once it is initialized.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  class MyClass {
      var property: MyClass?
  }

  var a: MyClass? = MyClass()
  var b: MyClass? = a
  a?.property = b
  ```

## **Concurrency**

### **1. How does Swift handle concurrency?**

Swift uses Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) and Swift’s concurrency model introduced with Swift 5.5, including `async/await` syntax.

- **GCD Example**:
  ```swift
  DispatchQueue.global().async {
      // Perform work in background thread
      DispatchQueue.main.async {
          // Update UI on main thread
      }
  }
  ```

- **Async/Await Example**:
  ```swift
  func fetchData() async -> Data {
      // Perform asynchronous work
  }

  Task {
      let data = await fetchData()
  }
  ```

## **Error Handling**

### **1. How do I handle errors in Swift?**

Swift uses `do-try-catch` blocks for error handling.

- **Example**:
  ```swift
  enum FileError: Error {
      case fileNotFound
      case unreadable
  }

  func readFile(at path: String) throws -> String {
      // Attempt to read file
  }

  do {
      let content = try readFile(at: "file.txt")
      print(content)
  } catch FileError.fileNotFound {
      print("File not found.")
  } catch {
      print("An unexpected error occurred: \(error).")
  }
  ```

## **Common Issues and Troubleshooting**

### **1. Why is my Swift code not compiling?**

- **Syntax Errors**: Check for typos or syntax mistakes.
- **Type Mismatches**: Ensure that variable types match expected types.
- **Unresolved Identifiers**: Verify that all identifiers are defined and imported correctly.

### **2. How do I resolve runtime crashes?**

- **Check for Nil

Values**: Ensure that optional values are safely unwrapped.
- **Debug with Xcode**: Use Xcode’s debugging tools to identify and fix runtime issues.
